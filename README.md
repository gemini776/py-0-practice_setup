# py-0-practice_setup
Setup to establish Python practice program 


I will be using the py-#- preamble to designate projects as I learn C++. My goal is to become competent at programming and using git version control. I will be doing many different tutorials and video lessons so I decided to create a repository for each project I build. I desire to build a strong portfolio that shows growth in my programming skills and abilities.
